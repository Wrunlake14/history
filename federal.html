        The Private Federal Reserve is Unconstitutional per Article I, Section 8, Clause 5 of the Constition.
        The Constitution explicitly vests Congress with the authority to issue the public currency and does not
        authorize its
        delegation to a private Federal Resverve. The name Federal Reserve was chosen to deceive the American people
        into
        believing that this private bank was part of the Federal Government, which it is not.

        Their Federal Reserve notes are created out of thin air and loans are created as soon as you sign the
        promissory
        note and you must do actual work to pay back these loans. On top of that they charge compounding
        interest or
        interest on top of interest called usury (enslavement of humanity). Before the unconstitutional Federal
        Reserve,
        our
        US Treasury was able to supply us money that was interest free and debt free.

                                <p>Book: The New Confessions of an Economic Hit Man by John Perkins.</p>
                            </a>
                            Perkins' memoir lays out in great detail how Economic Hitmen, backed by both overt and
                            covert
                            military force, are able to enslave countries around the world in an endless debt trap for
                            the
                            benefit of multi-national corporations and the global banking syndicate. In the 'New'
                            chapters,
                            Perkins shows that the techniques used by EHMs have been increasingly deployed "at home" to
                            ensnare American citizens, mostly through their state and local governments, in the same
                            debt
                            trap typically inflicted on emerging market economies. If you want to understand how "the
                            system" really works and not just lament "the rich" or "the corporations" read this book.

            <h3> The solution to our $30 Trillion Debt Problem:</h3><br>
    <br>

    TIPS:
            The act, which became Public Law 88-36 (77 Stat. 54), repealed the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 and related
            laws,
            repealed a tax on silver transfers, and authorized the Federal Reserve to issue one- and two-dollar bills,
            in addition
            to the notes they were already issuing. So, this isssue was the rise in silver prices which is true but in
            1964 there was issued a silver Kennedy Dollar.
    
    
            <br>
    














            Kennedy signed Executive Order No. 11110 On June 4, 1963 that continued the power of the U.S.
            Treasury to
            issue currency, without going through the Private Banker's Federal Reserve.

            That's all it takes is an executive order to start the process of ending the illegal Federal Reserve

            <p>
                With the banishment of the moneylenders and the abolition of usury(interest), taxes were moderate
                and there was no state debt. England experienced an unparalleled growth and prosperity. <b>The Average

                    14 weeks.</b> The men of the 15th century were so well paid that the purchasing power of
                their wages and standard of living would only be exceeded in the late 19th century. They used a tally
